## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- A .NET-compatible IDE or editor (Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code, etc.)

> [!TIP]
> @Toonic: _I recommend using [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) because it will setup everything for you._

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SimFell.git
   cd SimFell
   ```

2. Build and run the project:

   - **Using an IDE**: Open `SimFell.sln`, set the `SimFell` project as the startup project, and run.

   - **From the command line**:

     ```bash
     # Restore dependencies and build
     dotnet restore
     dotnet build SimFell/SimFell.csproj

     # Run the simulator
     dotnet run --project SimFell/SimFell.csproj
     ```

## Usage

Currently, SimFell runs as a command-line tool and outputs results to both the console and the `simulation.log` file in the root directory.

Example:

```bash
dotnet run --project SimFell/SimFell.csproj
```

Future releases will include a graphical interface and additional configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing .NET runtime**: Verify installation with `dotnet --version`; it should output `9.0.x`.
- **Build failures**: Try cleaning and restoring with:

  ```bash
  dotnet clean
  dotnet restore
  ```

- **No output or empty log**: Ensure your `Configs/` files (`*.simfell`) are correctly configured.
